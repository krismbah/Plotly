# Plotly

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to present an interactive exploration into the bacterial sample data collected from volunteers. The following tasks are to be completed: 

1. Create a Horizontal Bar Chart.
2. Create a Bubble Chart.
3. Create a Gauge Chart.
4. Customize the Dashboard.

## Results

***Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart***
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.:

***Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart***
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu:

## Summary

To summarize, one major drawback of this new design is that the user isn't given a dropdown menu of criteria to choose from within each filter. The criteria they may choose may not be existing. For futher development of the webpage, the following recommendations are suggested:

1. Change the filter elements to dropdown menus.
2. Include a greater dataset spanning more than two weeks of one year.
