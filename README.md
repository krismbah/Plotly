# Plotly

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to present an interactive exploration into the bacterial sample data collected from volunteers. The following tasks are to be completed: 

1. Create a Horizontal Bar Chart.
2. Create a Bubble Chart.
3. Create a Gauge Chart.
4. Customize the Dashboard.

## Results

***Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart***
Using knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.:

***Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart***
Using knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:

***Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart***
Using knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu:

## Summary

To summarize, our biological researchers collaborated to discover and document bacterial species which may be unknown to science. In particular, our researchers are interested in bacterial species which have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Our prominent laboratory has partnered with Improbable Beef (a food start-up) to research candidate species. Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing "meat" from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots. However, Improbable Beef is still searching for the illusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste. It is our hypothesis that there is a microorganism that can supply the next best taste. And we believe it can be found in bacteria found on the human body. The human body is a source for thousands of types of bacteria and different parts of the body harbor different species. We hypothesize that the ideal bacterial species to create synthetic beef may be found in the belly button. To test our hypothesis, we have sampled the navels of people from across the United States to identify bacterial species which colonize our belly buttons. Each volunteer's identity is anonymous and has been assigned an id number in order to protect their privacy. This dashboard was created for research participants to access in order to learn which bacterial species live in their navels For futher development of the webpage, the following customizations were implemented:

1. Add an image to the jumbotron.
2. Add background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage.
3. Add more information about the project as a paragraph on the page.
