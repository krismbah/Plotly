                The charts above present an interactive exploration into the bacterial sample data collected from volunteers.
                Our biological researchers collaborated to discover and document bacterial species which may be unknown to science.
                In particular, our researchers are interested in bacterial species which have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef.
                Our prominent laboratory has partnered with Improbable Beef (a food start-up) to research candidate species.
                Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing "meat" from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots.
                However, Improbable Beef is still searching for the illusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste.
                It is our hypothesis that there is a microorganism that can supply the next best taste. And we believe it can be found in bacteria found on the human body.
                The human body is a source for thousands of types of bacteria and different parts of the body harbor different species.
                We hypothesize that the ideal bacterial species to create synthetic beef may be found in the belly button.
                To test our hypothesis, we have sampled the navels of people from across the United States to identify bacterial species which colonize our belly buttons.
                Each volunteer's identity is anonymous and has been assigned an id number in order to protect their privacy.
                This dashboard was created for research participants to access in order to learn which bacterial species live in their navels.
                Who knows what they might find!
